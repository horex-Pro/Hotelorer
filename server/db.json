      "neighborhood_overview": "De Baarsjes is a young and creative neighborhood which has become more and more popular over the past few years. I love it for the great mix of people -every age group and background is represented-, and the local public amenities reflect that variety. You will find cheap local grocery stores and a brand new mosque alongside beautiful design stores and great coffee places.",

      "transit": "To reach my house from Central Station, you catch tram 13 (direction Geuzenveld) to tramstop Admiraal de Ruyterweg, which takes approximately 12 minutes. From there, it's a 5 minute walk to my house.  To reach my house from Schiphol, you catch a train to Amsterdam Lelylaan (7 mins) and take tram 17 (direction Centraal Station) to tramstop 'Witte de Withstraat' (6 mins). From the tramstop, it's a 5 min walk to my house. If you're travelling by car, there's usually plenty of space to park in front of or nearby the house. There's paid parking (2,40/hour) from Monday til Saturday 09h-24h. You can reach the city center (f.e. Dam Square) by foot in about 30 minutes. If you'd rather explore the city the way the locals do -by bike!- there's several bike rental shops closeby.",

      "interaction": "If you need any help during your stay, whether organising your public transport to the airport or finding a great local place to have dinner, I'm happy to help.",
      "house_rules": "No pets allowed, no smoking in the house, but feel free to smoke on the balcony. As I live in a quiet street, this is not a place for partying in the house.",
