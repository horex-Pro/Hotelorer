We have two children, a 7 year old girl and a 6 year old boy. We have been living in Amsterdam for 20 years and love the city! We enjoy the relaxed vibe and the fact that the city is so compact: One can walk or bike anywhere. \n  We are first time airbnb renters, but have done several home exchanges over the last years, all very successful. \n  We are looking forward to host you in our lovely house!",

There's paid parking (2,40/hour) from Monday til Saturday 09h-24h. You can reach the city center (f.e. Dam Square) by foot in about 30 minutes.
